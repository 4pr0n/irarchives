Summary
=====
NSFW reverse image search for reddit

Implementation
==============
http://i.rarchives.com (Warning: **NSFW**)

Overview
========
Many NSFW reddit posts contain more information about an image. 

The repo contains:
* scan.py
** a script to scrape images found in posts on reddit,
*** store image hash & post data in a database
*** store thumbnails of scraped data to the filesystem
* a web interface for searching the database

Notes
=====
There is no database included with the repo for obvious reasons. 

The database will have to be generated by the user or, if you ask nicely, you can have a copy of the current database which has over 1.5 million hashed images.
